  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In a <a href="/java/2015/06/06/simple-java-server.html">previous post</a>, I walked through how to build a simple HTTP server in Java that echoes back whatever request is issued by the user. While it’s a nice start for those new to server construction, it leaves a lot left to be desired in terms of functionality.</p>

<p>Of course, you could just continue to build on that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">while</code> loop, constructing a gargantuan nested conditional to deal with different requests appropriately. But that will leave you with some really gross code.</p>

<p>Even following the tried and true approach of building away before extracting/refactoring code can leave you with a bit of a mess. It’s hard to put together a good architecture for a complicated piece of software like an HTTP server without an early familiarity with what it might look like down the road.</p>

<p>At least, that was the trouble I found myself in after an initial attempt. I managed to decouple and extract most buckets of behavior from the core <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">while</code> loop, but there was one place where things got iffy: the method where the server determined what response to issue based on the request.</p>

<p>This is not a good place to fail - it’s basically the heart of the application. I knew the best approach would probably be to go ahead and rewrite the whole thing, but I was at a loss for how I could approach such a rewrite without duplicating the same error.</p>

<p>Luckily, after speaking with a few knowledgeable colleagues, I stumbled upon a role model of sorts: Clojure’s <a href="HTTPs://github.com/ring-clojure/ring">Ring</a>. Ring is a library for building web applications with Clojure, and it’s architecture provides some guidance as to how you can approach building an HTTP server for yourself.</p>

<p>While I’d recommend that anyone interested visit <a href="HTTPs://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki">the Ring wiki</a> for a more detailed explanation, the core of Ring’s architecture is a division of responsibilities among Handlers and Adapters.</p>

<p>Handlers manage the matching of requests to responses, taking one map that defines a request and returning another that defines the response. Adapters do the rest: setting up a port, formatting input into a map for the handler, formatting a response map into output for the client, and so forth.</p>

<p>Dividing up responsibilities along this fault line has several advantages:</p>

<p>First, putting the request-response matching work in the handler makes the codebase more manageable and extensible. Changes to how input and output are parsed are decoupled from changes to how you respond to a particular request. You can test and verify that specific requests match their designated responses in the handler, and then deal with other application behavior elsewhere.</p>

<p>Second, the two major components of a handler/adapter architecture can be further subdivided as necessary. If you only need to deal with a small subset of responses, perhaps you can get away with a single, isolated handler. If responsibilities proliferate, the handler can be further subdivided into various support objects/namespaces for the main handler.</p>

<p>With a server architecture built around the separation of handlers and adapters, it’s much easier to build a server you can be proud of. Good, decoupled code only gets you so far without a good, decoupled architecture, and the handler/adapter architecture lays the foundation for building up a good, decoupled code base.</p>
