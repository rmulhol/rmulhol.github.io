  <article class="post-content">
    <p>To get more familiar with Java, one of the resources I’ve been working through is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Complete-Reference-Ninth-Edition-ebook/dp/B00HSO0X6C"><em>Java: The Complete Reference, Ninth Edition</em></a>. It’s a bit of a long slog (the book is 1312 pages), but I’ve enjoyed getting a fairly comprehensive overview of the language while recreating the numerous example programs offered throughout.</p>

<p>Though I use an IDE (<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a>) for my own projects, I’ve been completing the exercises from the book in Vim for two reasons: (1) I want to get a good understanding of what’s going on ‘behind the curtain,’ without relying on all the legwork IntelliJ does for me; and, (2) I don’t want to create new projects in IntelliJ for each of the very small programs in the book (so far I’ve completed over 200, and most are fewer than 50 lines).</p>

<p>Recently, I was working on an example in Chapter 9, where the objective is to practice implementing interfaces. To do so, you first create an interface <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Callback</code>, then a class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Client</code> that implements the interface, and then finally a class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TestIface</code> that both declares an interface reference variable and calls the method from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Client</code> on it.</p>

<p>Working in Vim, I first placed all of these components (one interface and two classes) into a single file. It compiled and ran just fine.</p>

<p>The next lesson adds two more classes: one, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AnotherClient</code>, that implements the interface differently, and another, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TestIface2</code>, that calls the method from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AnotherClient</code> on an interface reference variable. So that I could minimize retyping, I opted to place each component in a separate file: one for the interface, and four for the respective classes.</p>

<p>The file containing the interface compiled just fine, but the classes were giving me guff:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="nc">Client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">java</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nl">error:</span> <span class="n">cannot</span> <span class="n">find</span> <span class="n">symbol</span>
<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Client</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="nc">Callback</span> <span class="o">{</span>
                        <span class="o">^</span>
  <span class="nl">symbol:</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Callback</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I was completely baffled. How could it be that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javac Callback.java</code> would work just fine, but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javac Client.java</code> would produce the error above? I could see that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Callback.class</code> did indeed reside in the exact same package directory as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Client.java</code>, but the compiler wasn’t finding it.</p>

<p>I opted to try it out in IntelliJ. While I don’t want to rely on the IDE as a shortcut, I was hoping that I could learn something by seeing how it fixed the problem. But this made things even more confusing - the <em>exact same</em> source code compiled in IntelliJ without a hitch.</p>

<p>I fooled around for awhile (reading through examples of similar problems on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16102893/cannot-find-symbol-saying-implemented-interface-not-found">stackoverflow</a>, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import</code> in myriad different ways, changing the names of the interface and classes, etc) trying to find an answer before I stumbled upon something that worked:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="o">..</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">javac</span> <span class="nc">MyPack</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nc">Client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">java</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It turns out that in order to compile a class that implements an interface and resides within a package, you have to back up out of that package and compile by providing the file directory that includes the package.</p>

<p>Who knew?</p>
