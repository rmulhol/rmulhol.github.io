  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Recently I’ve had the opportunity to do some work with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>, the JavaScript libary put together by Facebook for building user interfaces. It’s been a really cool experience, and I’m growing more comfortable working with React everyday.</p>

<p>That’s not to say the process has been hiccup free - it’s been littered with (surmountable) obstacles. Though that’s to be expected when you’re new to any library, it’s particularly pronounced in this instance by the absence of a standardized format for React projects.</p>

<p>You see, there is no <code>rails new ...</code> for React. There are several super helpful boilerplate <a href="https://github.com/petehunt/react-boilerplate">templates</a> and <a href="https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack">generators</a>, but they’re not uniform. People pretty much include whatever they think they’ll need, and they all have different ideas as to what exactly that is.</p>

<p>I’m not going to tell you that my preferences are any better than those of the folks who have done this work,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> but I am willing to wager that mine are more minimal. I’m interested in having the bare-bones setup for getting up and running, and we can add other stuff later.</p>

<p>So, in what follows, I want to lay out the steps for setting up a file directory you can use to build a React project. We’ll include only what we need to start hacking, and then cover further topics in subsequent posts. If you’re willing to hop on for the ride, let’s dive into part 1 of getting started with React.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Setting Up Your <code>package.json</code> File</strong></p>

<p>One thing we’ll be using to manage our project’s dependencies is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> - the Node Package Manager. If you don’t have that, you’ll want to <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node">install Node.js and npm</a> now.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Once you’ve got npm, you can run <code>npm init</code> in an empty directory to setup a basic <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json"><code>package.json</code></a> file. By answering the prompts, you’ll identify some key attributes of your project: its name, version, license, etc.</p>

<p><img src="http://rmulhol.github.io//assets/npm-init.png" alt="npm-init-execution" /></p>

<p>Once we’ve got a basic <code>package.json</code> file setup, we can add one of the more important dependencies for our project - React - with a single command: <code>npm install --save react</code>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Next, we can install some dev dependencies we’ll be needing: <code>npm install --save-dev browserify reactify</code>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>  <a href="https://github.com/substack/browserify-handbook">Browserify</a> will enable us to compile modules for the browser, and <a href="https://github.com/andreypopp/reactify">Reactify</a> will help Browserify to play nicely with the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jsx/">JSX</a> syntax we’ll be using in our React modules.</p>

<p>At this point, your <code>package.json</code> file should look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://rmulhol.github.io//assets/pkg-with-devDeps.png" alt="pkg-with-devDeps" /></p>

<p>We’ll want to add a build script to make it look like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://rmulhol.github.io//assets/pkg-with-build-script.png" alt="pkg-with-build-script" /></p>

<p>And then install <code>browserify</code> globally so that our script will execute: <code>npm install -g browserify</code>.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>That will do it for our <code>package.json</code> file, for now. Time to start building out the rest of our file directory structure.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Add Files/Directories</strong></p>

<p>Just by setting up our dependencies and build script, we’ve done most of the leg work necessary to get a React project up and running. The next step is pretty simple: put together the file directory structure.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways you could organize your directory, but to play nicely with our current setup, you’ll want to run the following commands:</p>

<p><img src="http://rmulhol.github.io//assets/file-directory-commands.png" alt="file-directory-commands" /></p>

<p>That will set up a file tree that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://rmulhol.github.io//assets/file-directory-tree.png" alt="file-directory-tree" /></p>

<p>At this point, we’re ready to put in some code!</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Filling in <code>index.html</code></strong></p>

<p>The <code>index.html</code> file stores the basic page we’ll be working on. You can fill it in like so:</p>

<noscript><pre>400: Invalid request
</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/51035643a1a4b29c9a23.js"> </script>

<p>The key to this file is the <code>section</code> with the <code>id</code> “react” - that’s the entry point for our React code. It’ll be filled in by the <code>bundle.js</code> script (which is generate by Browserify).</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Filling in <code>app.js</code></strong></p>

<p>Almost there! The next step is to pop some code into our <code>app.js</code> file that indicates what to put in the “react” <code>section</code>. You can do that like so:</p>

<noscript><pre>400: Invalid request
</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dfcb2fd783ada9654894.js"> </script>

<p>This code tells React to find the page element with the <code>id</code> “react” and put the preceding JSX code (which looks like raw html) there.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Build and Run</strong></p>

<p>At this point, we’ve got all the hand-written code we’re going to need. The next step is to run <code>npm run build</code>, which will trigger the build script we put in our <code>package.json</code> file.</p>

<p>After that’s complete, we’re ready to fire up our app! To do that, we need an http server. The easiest way to get one is probably to run <code>npm install -g http-server</code>.</p>

<p>Once that’s installed, head to your project’s root directory and run <code>http-server</code>. Pull up the browser and head over to http://localhost:8080/ and…</p>

<p><img src="http://rmulhol.github.io//assets/browser-view-hello-world.png" alt="browser-view-hello-world" /></p>

<p>It’s alive! That’s not exactly the fancy view we were hoping for when we decided to explore this newfangled UI library, but it’s a start!</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>So, we clearly have a lot more to learn before we can start really taking advantage of React’s power, but we are now working with the library. Just by installing a few dependencies, filling out a few files, and executing a few scripts, we’re right about where we’d expect to be with something like a <code>rails new ...</code> for React.</p>
