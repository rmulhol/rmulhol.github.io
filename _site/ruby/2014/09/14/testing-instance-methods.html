    <p>Once I decided to <a href="/ruby/2014/09/13/getting-started-with-tdd.html">get started with TDD in Ruby</a>, I developed a perhaps premature sense of pride in my ability to use TDD to write methods. Following the red-green-refactor model, I would write a test for a method, write the code to make it pass, revise for elegance and maintainability, and then repeat those steps until the method accomplished everything I wanted. But as soon as I got ambitious and started trying TDD with classes, I ran into some trouble: a NameError telling me of some “undefined local variable or method.”</p>

<p>What was going wrong? Well, as I progressed from files containing single methods to full classes, I was writing tests for <em>instance</em> methods without initializing an instance of that class upon which I would call those methods in my tests.</p>

<p>So, for example, lets say I wanted to write a method that returns “Hello, world!” Simple enough. First, I’d write a test in my project’s spec directory:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'hello_world'</span>

<span class="n">describe</span> <span class="s2">"hello_world"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">"returns 'Hello, World!'"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hello_world</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to</span> <span class="n">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Watch it fail. Generate a blank file in my projects lib directory named hello_world.rb. Watch it fail again. Now add some code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello_world</span>
  <span class="s2">"Hello, world!""
end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Run the tests again. Everything passes. Great!</p>

<p>But what if I wanted that method to be nested in a class? Well, I’ve already written the tests, so lets add the class and see what happens. Back to the hello_world.rb file:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">HelloWorld</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello_world</span>
    <span class="s2">"Hello, world!"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Run the test and disaster ensues:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">rspec</span> <span class="n">spec</span>
<span class="no">F</span>

<span class="no">Failed</span> <span class="ss">examples:

</span><span class="n">rspec</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">/</span><span class="n">spec</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">hello_world_spec</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">rb</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">4</span> <span class="c1"># hello_world returns 'Hello, world!'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>How can this be? I haven’t changed the method!</p>

<p>Well, now that I’ve nested my (instance) method inside of a class, the test needs to initialize an instance of that class upon which it can call my method. Changing the test like this solves our problem:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'hello_world'</span>

<span class="n">describe</span> <span class="s2">"hello_world"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">"returns 'Hello, World!'"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">my_instance</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">HelloWorld</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span>
    <span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">my_instance</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">hello_world</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to</span> <span class="n">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So, altogether, not too complicated. In order to test an instance method, your tests need to initialize an instance that can call that method.</p>

<p>Bonus side note: if you’re testing multiple instance methods, you can DRY up your code by initializing your instance just once:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'hello_world'</span>

<span class="n">describe</span> <span class="s2">"hello_world"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">let</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:my_instance</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">described_class</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">"returns 'Hello, World!'"</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">my_instance</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">hello_world</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to</span> <span class="n">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello, world!"")
  end
end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Though, I must advise that you proceed with caution, as I’ve heard that relying on “let” <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/lets-not">isn’t necessarily a best practice</a>.</p>
