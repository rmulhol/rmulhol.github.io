    <p>This week, I was tasked with putting together a presentation about the command line. Having stuck  to the most basic Unix operations (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mv</code>, etc.) throughout most of my time developing software, I had to do a bit a research.</p>

<p>Though I learned a lot of things preparing for the talk, perhaps the most useful tool I picked up is one that helps you reach into your command history quickly and easily: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CTRL-R</code>.</p>

<p>Typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CTRL-R</code> in the command line opens up an interactive search line (with autocomplete) for matching previous commands with the bare minimum of its opening characters. Once you hit enter, it’s immediately executed.</p>

<p>Of course, you can accomplish the same task with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!&lt;str&gt;</code> (replacing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;str&gt;</code> with whichever opening characters you would search for), but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CTRL-R</code> gives you certainty that you’ll get the right command right away, and the ability to execute it immediately<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Having located this tool, I’m thinking it will never be necessary to use the up/down arrow keys for toggling through command line history ever again. Good riddance. Using CTRL-R allows faster retrieval with guaranteed precision.</p>

<p>Finding this tool has also sparked my interest in discovering more sophisticated Unix commands. I’m excited to find out what other operations I can perform to improve my efficiency and productivity as I continue to work with the command line.</p>

    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>To get certainty, you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!&lt;str&gt;:p</code> (to see the command this search found) and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!!</code> (to excecute) once you’re sure it’s right, but this inserts an extra step. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
