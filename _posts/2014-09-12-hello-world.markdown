Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Rob and I'm working to become a software craftsman. I'll be using this space to document my learning and share tips I come up with along the way.

Right now, most of the work I do is in Ruby (but I look forward to learning new languages soon!). So, in the syntax I love for its simplicity:

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Hello, World!"
{% endhighlight %}

Feel free to check out my [Github page][github-profile] to see what I'm working on now!
